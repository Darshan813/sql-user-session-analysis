- **Query 1**: Users who have not logged in for the past 5 months.
- **Query 2**: Quarterly user and session counts with percent change.
- **Query 3**: Users who logged in January 2024 but not in November 2023.
- **Query 4**: Percent change in session counts compared to the previous quarter.
- **Query 5**: Highest session score for each day.
- **Query 6**: Users who logged in every day since their first login.
- **Query 7**: Dates with no logins.

- ## Key Concepts
- **Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to generate date ranges.
- **Joins** and filtering techniques to analyze user behavior.
- **Window functions** for rank and lag operations.
